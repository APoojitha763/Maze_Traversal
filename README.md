# Maze Traversal
Maze traversal involves navigating through a maze from a starting point to a destination, avoiding obstacles and finding the optimal path. This project implements maze traversal using to efficiently explore possible paths within the maze.

# Key Features
Obstacle Detection: The algorithm identifies walls and obstacles to ensure only valid paths are followed. <br>
Backtracking: If a path leads to a dead-end, the algorithm backtracks to previous cells to explore alternative routes.

# Tech Stack

Java: Primary programming language used to implement the maze traversal logic, leveraging object-oriented principles for clean and modular code.<br>
Data Structures: Utilized Javaâ€™s built-in collection to manage path exploration and backtracking efficiently.<br>
Algorithms: BFS for efficient pathfinding within the maze.<br>
